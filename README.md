##Problem Statement

A cab companies like Uber,Ola has nowadays become synonymous with the public taxi system due to its portals in almost all the countries of the world. From providing the rental cab to the personal cab, carpool, bike rides, and luxury cab services, Uber is offering every possible conveyance system to lure their customers.But the current ecosystem has many loopholes due to the centralized approach to manage the business operations. Like other industries, blockchain is all set to bring disruption to Uber and other cab service platforms.With the increasing use of smartphone and internet connectivity, the on-demand transportation industry is expecting to grow eightfold by 2030. Despite the high demand for cab services, there are countless problems with the existing platforms. Therefore, creating a decentralized platform for drivers and riders can help both the parties to connect with each other without requiring mediators.

##Advantages of Using BlockChain in Cab Services Platform

#Cost Reduction
Blockchain would enable riders to directly connect with drivers through the decentralized platform, reducing the additional costs incurred due to the involvement of too many intermediaries.

#Transparency in the pricing
Due to the ability of the blockchain to offer transparency, riders would be able to know how cab company functions.The pricing will be fixed on the basis of specific criterion defined in the smart contracts, bringing trust and transparency to the system.

#Economic Opportunity
With the approach of decentralized car sharing platform, anyone can earn income using their personal vehicle. The removal of services fees due to the elimination of intermediaries can increase the business opportunities for everyone with a smartphone and a safe modern vehicle.

#Safety and security standards
The rules defined in the smart contracts would ensure the non-involvement of drivers in any sort of criminal activities by generating an accurate rating for them. It will help riders decide if they want to take a ride with a specific service provider or not.

#Environmentally Cleaner
Ridesharing could be one of the great use-cases of the decentralized cab service platform, leading to the pollution-free environment.Since people will be able to share the ride seamlessly, fewer cars might be required, decreasing the metal and plastic amount that has various harmful effects. It will help the world move towards a cleaner approach with every car removed from the road due to decentralized ridesharing platform.
